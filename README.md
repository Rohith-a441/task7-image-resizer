# task7-image-resizer
🖼️ A Python-based image resizer tool that automates resizing and format conversion of multiple images in batch using the Pillow library.

# 🖼️ Task 7 – Python Image Resizer Tool (Internship Project)

> 🔧 A simple, powerful batch image resizer and converter tool built using **Python** and the **Pillow** library. Automates the process of resizing multiple images to a fixed size (800x800) and converting them to `.jpg` format in just one click.

---

## 🚀 Objective

To develop a Python script that automates the batch resizing and format conversion of images present inside a folder, and saves the resized images to another folder — all using a clean, maintainable codebase.

---

## ✅ Features

- 🔁 Batch processing of images in any format (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.jpeg`, `.bmp`, `.gif`)
- 📐 Automatically resizes all images to **800x800 pixels**
- 💾 Saves resized images in clean `.jpg` format
- 📂 Neatly separates **input** and **output**
- 📸 Includes screenshots for clear proof of execution and structure
- 💻 Fully explained code for beginner understanding
- ✨ Clean folder structure and code formatting
